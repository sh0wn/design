# Mini PRD
*Don't waste time building the wrong thing! This is a "one-page" document that forces me to clearly explain what the problem is, who I'm solving it for, and why I'm solving it.*

## Project Name:
[Feature or project name]

## Description:
[What is it? 1-2 sentence overview]

## Problem Statement
**Write a single paragraph (3-5 sentences) that includes:**
* **WHO** is affected (target audience or user group)
* **WHAT** is the conflict (the core problem or pain point)
* **WHY** this matters (why it needs to be addressed)

### Your problem statement:
[Write your problem statement here]

```
EXAMPLE PROBLEM STATEMENT (for reference)
"Veterans are frustrated with the site's search results, because they display out-of-date information and promote irrelevant matches from a narrow slice of the site's content. Since many veterans are logged in when they use it, they expect the search engine to anticipate their needs, interests, and geographical area. Finally, much of the site's important content is contained in PDF, making it difficult to index and display in the results."

BREAKDOWN:
WHO: Veterans
CONFLICT: Search results are outdated and irrelevant, limited to a narrow content slice
WHY: Veterans expect personalized results when logged in; important content is inaccessible
  ```

## Why Solve This Now?
**Urgency:** [One-line statement: What makes this important right now?]
**Evidence:** [At least one source - Required. Can be data, observations, user feedback, support tickets, session recordings, etc.]
* Evidence source 1:
* Evidence source 2 (optional):
* Evidence source 3 (optional):
⠀
## High-Level Approach
[Describe the solution with enough specificity that a developer or AI tool could understand the core interaction/flow. What does this look like in the product? What are the key elements of your approach to solving the problem?]

## Goals & Success
**How do we know if we've solved the problem?**
[What does success look like?]
### Metrics:
[What metrics are you intending to move? Explain why these metrics are important if not obvious.]

## Notes:
* This PRD is designed for solo drafting → team pitching → rapid prototyping
* Evidence requirement: Minimum of one source to maintain evidence-based decision making
